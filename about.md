As a developer and researcher, I many times stumble across frustrating challenges with little to no advice from Stack Overflow or other Googlable resources.
Thus this site was born to aid others who may also be running into the same challeges. If you have any questions or corrections, please don't hesitate to hit
me up at my [Fediverse account]([http://www.twitter.com/JacobTorrey](https://mountaincommunity.co/@jacob)) or submit a [pull-request to this blog's source tree](https://github.com/ranok/ranok.github.io).
